# Synced Scroll Chrome Extension

This repository holds the extension's source code.

Synchronized scroll in multiple tabs/windows simultaneously will help review and compare content on pages.

Extension should be activated for each tab separately.

Supports page refresh and URL change, as it is tracking current tab, not current website.

Hold CTRL (Mac OS) or CTRL+ALT(other OS) while scrolling to scroll only current tab - this will help adjusting view for pages with different length.
